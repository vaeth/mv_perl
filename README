mv_perl - A collection of perl scripts (replacement in files, syncing dirs etc)

This is a loose collection of some useful and less useful perl scripts.
Most scripts are rather old and have not been maintained for a long time
except for minor bugfixes or cosmetical issues.
With some specified exceptions, all scripts run with Perl 4 without
requiring any modules.

For installation just put the content of bin somewhere into your $PATH.
Also put the files of the subdirectory zsh into your $fpath to obtain
zsh completion support. (If you do not have root access, you can add the
corresponding directory with fpath+=("...")) before you
call compdef from your zsh initialization files).

For installation under Gentoo, you can use the ebuild from the mv overlay
(which is available by layman).

Here is a brief overview of the scripts:

- plrep v2.5 (Perl regular expression). This script provides among a more
  user-friendly variant of the well-known grep (with perl regular
  expressions) a method to replace regular expression within the
  files. Special features include interactive replacement, recursive
  directory handling, colorized display (adaptable for various terminal
  colors since v2.1), readable output also for mixed text/binary files
  (conversion to printable characters, very luxury truncation of lines),
  and also interactive replacement/grep of expressions across multiple lines
  (experimental since v2.1).

  With plrep --man you get a detailed help as a manpage (new since v2.1).

  This script requires Perl 5 (together with some modules).
  If you really must use Perl 4, you can use the scripts prep and
  rrep below which together have almost the same functionality.

- patchdirs v1.10. This script serves two purposes:
  1. It allows to keep directory trees in sync for computers which have no
     direct connection. On the one hand, it allows to (recursively) list files
     together with their checksums (and dates, owners, modes).
     On the other hand, it can use that information to reconstruct all file
     renamings/deletions/copies (and owner, date, mode-changes) based on the
     checksum information. Even circular renamings (like swappings of
     filenames) can be reconstructed.
     Of course, this script requires a checksum utility which provides a
     sufficiently strong checksum (by default, the perl Digest::MD5 module
     is used, but not mandatory: other programs are also supported).
     The new release finally supports also copies of files,
     changes of directory names, and stores/restores symbolic links.
  2. This script is also able to look for double files (where duplicates are
     recognized by equal checksums). Since checksum information can be stored,
     this is particularly useful if frequently new files must be compared
     against a given directory tree. (If you want more reliable information
     than only a checksum comparison, use the "double" perl script of this
     collection).

- patchdirs-ls v1.3. This is somewhat similar to patchdirs but can only
  reconstruct from an "ls --recursive" output exclusively on the base
  of names. This is very fast and requires no checksum module/utility.
  However, circular renamings can of course not be recognized.
  This script is still in experimental state. It requires at least
  Perl 5 (with elementary modules).

- rendirs v5.3. The "very standard" ISO9660 CD-Rom format only allows names
  of 8+3 characters. If there are some reasons to use this format with
  with non-packaged files, it is often convenient to create
  additionally a list containing the original filenames (and perhaps
  with a small description of the files). This script renames the
  files corresponding to such a list.
  Perl 5 (with elementary modules) is required.

- commlist v1.1. Print lines common to two list of file resp. contained in
  only one of these lists. This is similar to the standard unix comm utility,
  but deals with unsorted input/output.
  Perl 5 (with elementary modules) is required.

- sshconfig v1.2. If you frequently ssh/scp/sftp/rsync to computers with a
  dynamic IP address, you will find this script very useful.
  It modifies/creates a ~/.ssh/config file for you such that you can
  conveniently use the "real" hostname in your commands while the correct
  IP address is used (enter the IP address only once for running the script).
  From a security aspect, this script is what you should use in order to
  associate the correct fingerprint to the host, even if its IP address
  changes. This helps you to detect "man in the middle" attacks.

- prep v1.1 (Perl regular expression). Similar to the well-known grep but
  with perl regular expressions and possibility to recurse into
  subdirectories.

- rrep v1.1 (Replace regular expression). As prep above, but in addition,
  it is possible to replace the regular expressions in the files
  (interactively or non-interactively). Very flexible. You should
  also have a look at the script plrep.

- find_double v1.1. Looks for double files (the user may decide whether equal
  names and/or equal content count as double). Needs only O(n log(n))
  comparisons in the mean.
  See also the "patchdirs" script of this collection.

- renreg v1.2. Rename and/or number a set of files using regular expressions.

- changecase v1.1. A very simple script which allows to change filenames
  to upper or lower case (including directory names, recursively).
  Very useful in connection with DOS partitions or archives.

- comp v1.2. Similar to diff -r -q, but compares also attributes, time,
  owner, ... Also calls like comp *.tex DIR are admissible.

- touch.difference v1.1. Correct times of files by a daylight saving offset

- touchdirs v1.2. Touch directories according to their newest file
